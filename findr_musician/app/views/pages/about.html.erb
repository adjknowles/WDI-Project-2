We make scheduling so easy that your only worry will be skyrocketing your skills.</p>

<p>Choosing the perfect music teacher is never easy, that's why we do our best to give you a broad selection to choose from!</p>

<p>All Findr Musician teachers are exceptional music professionals that will guide you to quickly reach your learning goals.</p>

<p>Book, modify or cancel lessons with a simple click from your My Lessons dashboard: we want things to be super easy!</p>


<h2>Our Values</h2>

<h3>Intuitive, innovative and respectful.</h3>

<p>What we would want to overhear someone saying about us? “Findr Musician is useful, brilliant and really clever”. And, that’s what we aim to create, every day.</p>

<p>There’s nothing more satisfying than meeting someone for the first time, telling them who we are and them waving our app around on their phone, saying “Did you create this?! Cool”.</p>
