# WDI-Project-2
Second Project

Ruby on Rails Website

Findr Musician

On the page:

title
3 buttons - start, instructions & new game
timer
4 x 4
question display
3 answer buttons, which appear when player selects a square


Game play:

	
the player can click on the instructions button to reveal game instructions.
they then click start to begin the game.
the player will click on a square and the question will appear in the display to the side of the grid.
the square will change colour to show it has been selected.
the player will then be able to pick 1 of 3 options by clicking the relevant button
if the player enters the correct answer, the square will change colour and the player can move on to another square.
if the player enters the incorrect answer, the square will go back to the original colour and the player can try again/do another square.
the game ends when the timer runs out. The score will be displayed.
if the player correctly answers all 16 squares within the 30 seconds, the game will end and the timer will stop and score will be displayed.
the object of the game is to get as many questions correct as possible, turning all the squares a different colour.
at the end of game play the new game button can be clicked to begin a new game.

Technologies used:

In this project I have used HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Ruby and Rails.


Approach taken:

- Brainstormed some possible ideas
- Made a plan using the chosen idea
- Created a Trello board outlining what needed to be done, and depending on their importance, the order in which they needed to be executed.
- Produced an ERD diagram, mapping out the models and their relationships with one another.
- Created wireframes using Balsamiq, displaying how I imagined the website and its various pages to look.
- I then created a few test projects. After setting up the first test without Devise, I created the second with a User model using Devise and a scaffolded Instrument and Lesson models.
- Then I tested the relationships in the Rails console.
- Once this was all working as expected, I created the main project, replicating the 
I then created all the (empty) files and directories within my project folder.
Wrote pseudo code.
I then created a basic HTML structure, to which I added some simple CSS styling, so as to create something simple to look at within the browser.
I then concentrated on the javascript.
I initially wrote my code in javascript, but later changed much of it to JQuery.
First I created all the event listeners and global variables.
I then built functions around these to create the game play.
Once this was all done, I went back to the CSS styling to perfect the layout of the game.


Functions used:

getInstructions
updateTimer
getEquation
generateRandomAnswer
shuffleAnswers
chooseAnswer
newGame


If I had more time:

I would have created 3 levels of game play of differing degrees of difficulty.
Create a high score feature that updates when the player scores higher than the previous turn.
Add sound.
Refacter the code - make it dryer.


Initial ideas:

Originally I was going to do a picture quiz based on a theme. But I then realised that once you have played it once, you're probably going to remember the answers if you play it again.
So then came the idea of a mathamatical quiz, where the questions are completely random and two of the answers are also random. This means that you can play as many times as you like.


Challenges:

I found creating the timer function very challenging. Even more so was getting the timer to stop if the player answered all 16 questions correctly.
Generating random answers that were close to the correct answer was also a challenge. It took quite a bit of playing around with the formulas to get it to what it is now. It's still not perfect of course!
